##### Sorting
    - It is a process to arrange the alphabet/Numbers in Ascending Order (by default).

##### Sorting Algorithm
    - Bubble Sort -> Time Complexity O(N^2), Space: O(1)
    - Selection Sort -> Time Complexity O(N^2), Space: O(1)
    - Insertion Sort -> Time Complexity O(N^2), Space: O(1)
    - Quick Sort -> Time Complexity O(N^2), Space: O(N)
    - Heap Sort -> Time Complexity O(NlogN), Space: O(1)
    - Merge Sort -> Time Complexity O(NlogN), Space: O(N)
    - Counting Sort -> Time Complexity O(N+K), Space: O(K)
    - Radix Sort -> Time Complexity O(N*K), Space: O(N+K)
    - Bucket Sort -> Time Complexity O(N^2), Space: O(N)

    Quick Sort Time Complexity varies b/w O(nlogn) to O(n^2) - most of the time it is O(nlogn) but worst case O(n^2)

    Merge Sort variation TimSort is used in Python, Java Android and Swift. 

    Javascript Array.sort(), it totally depends on browser which sorting algorithm to be implement.
    Safari, Webkit, etc. uses selection sort whereas Mozilla uses merge sort.
