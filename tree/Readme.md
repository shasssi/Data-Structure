    - Node (also called vertex)
    - Edge
    - Siblings
    - Children
    - Subtree
    - Leaf nodes
    - Height of the tree

##### Binary Tree
    - Binary Trees special case
    - A Tree whose elements have at most 2 children means max 2 children
    - we name them: Left child & Right child

##### Binary Tree Representation
    - A Tree is represented by a pointer to the topmost node in tree
    - if Tree is empty, means the value of root is NULL
    - A tree node contains 3 parts
        - Data
        - pointer to the left child
        - pointer to the right child
